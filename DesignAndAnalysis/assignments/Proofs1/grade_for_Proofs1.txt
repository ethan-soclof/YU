Graph Properties

-1.5: you state that there is a range of 0..v-1 possibilities, but that
 mean *v* possibilities which moots your use of the pigeonhole
 principle!

Probability ("Coin Flipping") Properties

good work.  meta-point: this "Analyze ﬂips in sets of 2 ﬂips. If a set
of 2 ﬂip results contains both a 0 and a 1 (as opposed to 0 and 0, or
1 and 1), add the ﬁrst ﬂip result of that set to the ﬁnal result" is
(almost) the algorithm, and more clear than the pseudo-code you
present which i think is more low-level than it needs to be (because
it gets in the way of grasping the core idea of "pair flips").
