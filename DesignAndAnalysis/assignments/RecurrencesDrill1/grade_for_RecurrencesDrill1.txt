-0.7: for several questions, you didn't take the final step of using
 the gaussian identity to simplify the summation.  probably
 inadvertantly, but the assignment did supply them so that you could
 use them

"You may want to review, and use, the “summation” identities (above), speciﬁcally Gauss’s summation identity.

You will likely lose points if you don’t keep these points in mind."

otherwise, good work!


7.1.1 (Give a recurrence formula T(n) for the running time of f()) -- 3pts


7.1.2 (Give a recurrence W(n) that models the returned integer output of f(n)) -- 3 pts

8.1.1 (recurrence formulas for the worst-case performance of P(k) (populate()) -- 3 pts 

8.1.2 (recurrence formulas for the worst-case performance of T(n) (test). Your formulation for T(n) must include P() by “reference”) -- 1pts
