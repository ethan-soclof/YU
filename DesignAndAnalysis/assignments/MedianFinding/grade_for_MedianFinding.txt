Grade for assignment [SoclofEthan]: 8/10

BEFORE you freak out on the grade -- fix the compilation bug (ONLY
THAT ISSUE), and I'll reevaluate the grade for the coding portion of
this assignment with reduced penalty.  You have about a day to do this
and ask for a regrade.


very good work on the first half of the assignment, i especially liked
your approach to proving correctness in terms of four sets.

Eitan -- i really don't like to give a code grade based on "not
compiling" but no choice here.  i looked at your code, and don't see
how could it compile even for you!

Problem invoking 'maven compile': aborting this run

1. (5%): A paragraph explaining why vanilla binary search cannot be used to
solve this problem.

2. (5%): A paragraph describing the core idea in your algorithm: how will your
algorithm address the fact that vanilla binary search cannot be used to solve
the problem?

3. (40%): A pseudo-code description of your algorithm in terms of the problem deﬁnition.

• As discussed in lecture: your description should neither be expressed as
  (low-level) code (that’s the programming part) nor expressed as (high-level)
  English (that’s the job of your ﬁrst two paragraphs!).

• You must describe the algorithm “crisply” and in terms that enable you to
  specify a recurrence relation for Q(n). The recurrence must use precise
  notation that matches your algorithm description.

• Show (using any technique discussed in class) that your recurrence relation
  satisﬁes the performance requirements.

• Supply a proof that your algorithm is correct: more speciﬁcally, that the
  eventual answer is in fact the median value of the 2n numerical values from
  the two databases.

The remaining 50% of the grade for this assignment is based on the programming
portion of this assignment

  
take #2

ok: passes performance test, fails two correctness tests (possibly
because of failure to override hashCode and equals per exhaustive
discussion last semester).

deducting for these errors plus take #1 errors

please note that I may not waive the basic requirements in future
assignments.
